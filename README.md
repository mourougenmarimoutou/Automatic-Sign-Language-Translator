# Automatic Sign Language Translator

## Introduction
This project was carried out as part of the *Computer Vision* course within the Polycomp√©tences program at Polytech Clermont.  
The objective is to design an automatic sign language translator capable of detecting and recognizing signs captured through a computer camera.

## Work Completed
The project was divided into three main stages:
1. Building a large, labeled dataset  
2. Designing and training a neural network for sign detection  
3. Evaluating and testing the model  

To achieve this, we developed several scripts to generate a labeled dataset, later expanded using data augmentation techniques.  
The dataset was then used to train a recognition model, which was tested first on still images and later on live video streams.

## Skills and Competencies
Through this project, we gained practical experience in:  
- **Computer Vision**: image acquisition, preprocessing, and real-time video processing  
- **Deep Learning**: dataset creation, data augmentation, neural network training, and evaluation  
- **Software Development**: scripting in Python, modular design, and testing  
- **Teamwork & Project Management**: collaborative development and iterative testing
